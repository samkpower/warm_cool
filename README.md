# Warm/Cool
Exploratory study into the properties of "warm" and "cool" colours as expressed by the RGB colour model. 

Check out my research log here: http://samkpower.github.io/warm_cool/

This study is foundational research for a tool that will help users build better colour palettes. Have you ever tried to create a
colour scheme with a tool like [Adobe Colour](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/?base=2&rule=Triad&selected=0&name=My%20Color%20Theme&mode=rgb&rgbvalues=0.7,0.06999999999999998,0.06999999999999998,1,0.9879032258064626,0.09999999999999998,1,0,0,0.07999999999999999,0.5221052631580096,0.8,0.03500000000000003,0.44333333333343944,0.7&swatchOrder=0,1,2,3,4)?

It's painlessly easy to make a really hideous colour palette. I'd like a tool that will do the opposite - 
instantly give me a great colour scheme with very little effort.

Despite the fact that taste in colour is subjective, I hypothesize that visually pleasing colour schemes can be 
generated with greater than chance accuracy if determined as a function of the proportionate saturation, contrast, and temperature levels of a set of colours.

Currently, we already have established measurements colour saturation and contrast.
However our understanding of warmth and the role of proportion in a colour palette have been much less explored.
